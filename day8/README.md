## Day 8

### Challenge

The first real challenge for me. I commited 
the good old mistake of trying to be too smart 
and I took me a long time to fix bugs related to that. 

Implementing the logic and simulating it ended up giving the correct solution,
but giving the amount of iterations for this simulation, part 2 ends up taking
a very long time to execute, and it's a prime option to revisit for optimizations
