## Day 12

### Challenge

This was the culmination of the advent. In paper the solution could've been very hard but at the end, the naive approach
gave the correct answer

### Problem

This was a packing problem, with complex shapes that needed to fill a square area. I really don't know how to start
solving this in a general way, but I got lucky...

### Solution

The fist naive approximation was to find the area of each package and sum it all up, comparing it to the total area.
That ended up being enough for the challenge, and that's 24 stars.
