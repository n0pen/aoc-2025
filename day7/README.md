## Day 4

### Challenge

The challenge in this one was not in the logic of it,
but in the size of the search space.

Part 1 was a very simple celular automata, but I had to 
read the instructions to actually get the correct solution

The search space for part 2 was too big, and to solve
it in a straightforward way, I had to use memoization.

Go doesn't have any nice way to memoize function invocations,
but the built-in map struct is the very nice for this purpose
