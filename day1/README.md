### Day 1
### Challenge

For day one, as starter challenge, it was quite easy to understand and there were 
not many challenges for the implementation: all the logic was in the instructions
and I only had replicate that to solve the challenge.

One special consideration for myself. I'm learning Golang during this challenge,
so I'm getting used to it.
